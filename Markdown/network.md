# Network Architecture and Configuration

This section provides a high-level overview of the network architecture and configuration, including IP addressing, VLANs, and firewall rules.

## Network Architecture

Network architecture refers to the layout of network devices and services. It is designed to cater to the connectivity needs of client devices. In this network, the architecture includes devices like the ARRIS Surfboard S33, Router Ubiquiti UDR, NETGEAR Switch (GS305), ASUS Chromebox 3, and NETGEAR Nighthawk Tri-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System.

## IP Addressing

IP addressing is a unique identifier assigned to each device in the network. This allows devices to communicate with each other and the internet. For instance, the ASUS Chromebox 3 might have an IP address like 192.168.1.2.

## VLANs

Virtual LANs (VLANs) are logical divisions at the data link layer (Layer 2). They can enhance network performance and security. For example, there might be a separate VLAN for the ASUS Chromebox 3 and the NETGEAR Nighthawk Mesh System.

## Firewall Rules

Firewall rules control the flow of traffic into and out of the network. They are crucial for protecting the network from external threats. For instance, the Router Ubiquiti UDR might have firewall rules set up to block certain types of traffic.

Please note that this is a high-level overview. The specific details of your network architecture, IP addressing, VLANs, and firewall rules will depend on your specific network configuration and requirements. For more detailed information, consider consulting with a network professional or referring to the documentation for your specific network devices.

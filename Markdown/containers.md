# Containerization Technologies in My Network

Welcome to my network! In this network, I have employed containerization technologies to manage and run various applications. Containerization allows me to isolate these applications, making them portable, scalable, and easy to manage.

## What are Docker Containers?

Docker is like that box for computer programs. Normally, computer programs need specific settings and other programs to work correctly. These requirements can vary from one computer to another, which sometimes makes it hard for the program to run the same way on different computers. Docker packages up the program and everything it needs into a "container" (like the train set box). This container can be moved to different computers, and because it has everything the program needs inside it, the program will always run the same way, no matter where it is. This makes it easier for developers to develop, ship, and run applications consistently across different environments.

## Docker Containers

I have utilized Docker, a popular containerization platform, to run the following applications:

1. [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/): Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole. It helps to block ads and protect my devices from unwanted content.

2. [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/v0.8.3/): Homepage is a customizable start page that allows me to access my favorite links, bookmarks, and widgets in a single interface.

3. [Paperless](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/): Paperless is a document management system that helps me organize and digitize my paper documents, making them searchable and easily accessible.
 Assistant OS image you downloaded in step 2 as the bootable disk.

4. [Stirling-PDF](https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF): Stirling-PDF is a tool that allows me to convert various file formats to PDF. It helps me manage and share documents in a standardized format.

5. [12ft](https://12ft.io/): 12ft is a platform that enables me to deploy and manage my own cloud infrastructure. It provides a scalable and flexible environment for running applications.

6. [HRConvert2](https://github.com/zelon88/HRConvert2): HRConvert2 is a self-hosted drag-and-drop file conversion server & file sharing tool that supports 86 file formats. It also offers 4 color schemes & 13 end-user selectable languages. It helps me streamline HR data processing and analysis.

By using containerization technologies, I can enjoy several benefits:

- **Isolation**: Each application runs in its own container, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other. This isolation enhances security and stability.

- **Portability**: Containers are lightweight and portable, allowing me to easily move them across different environments without worrying about dependencies or compatibility issues.

- **Scalability**: With containerization, I can easily scale my applications up or down based on demand. This flexibility helps me optimize resource utilization and handle varying workloads.

- **Ease of Management**: Containerization simplifies the management of applications. I can easily deploy, update, and monitor containers using container orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
